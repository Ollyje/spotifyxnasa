# SPOTIFY X NASA

**Tune into the Universe!**

Spotify X NASA is a unique project that combines music and space science. It allows users to create a playlist of songs ordered by BPM (beats per minute) alongside fascinating data about Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) from the same month.

## Features

- **Year and Genre Input**: Select your desired year and music genre.
- **BPM Sorted Playlist**: Generate a playlist of songs sorted from highest to lowest BPM.
- **CME Data Integration**: Explore descriptions of Coronal Mass Ejections, sorted from highest to lowest speeds, for the same time period as your playlist.

## How It Works

1. **Input Year and Genre**: Enter the year and genre you’re interested in.
2. **Playlist Creation**: The tool retrieves a list of songs matching your criteria, sorted by BPM.
3. **Space Data Pairing**: It pulls data about CMEs from NASA’s records for the same month and provides a description of their speeds.
4. **Enjoy the Cosmic Connection**: Listen to your playlist while contemplating the speeds of solar phenomena.
